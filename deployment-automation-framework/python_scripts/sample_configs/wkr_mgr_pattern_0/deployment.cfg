[cluster]
# cluster_configuration can be manual or automated.
# Allowed Values: manual, automated.
# 1. Manual Configuration - Available
#    If manual is selected you have to configure config.pp file 
#    according to the cluster data.
# 2. Automated Configuration - Not implemented yet
#    If automated is selected you have to specify how many nodes
#    are there in the given cluster. NO need to configure 
#    configure.pp file.

# When spawning instance this flavor is used 
# e.g.: 2GB RAM | 20GB HDD | 2 VCPU -> 50% CPU activity observed in
# the 19.11 OpenStack cloud. Therefore this flavor is ideal for the 
# WSO2 server configuration
# DO NOT use flavors in the range of 1GB RAM and 1 VCPU. 
# It will cause to run 100% CPU and possible puppet catalog run 
# timeouts and catalog run failures.
