       ant run-class -Djar.name=org.wso2.carbon.esb.tests-4.x.x-tests.jar -Dclass.name=ProxyServiceWithWSAddressingTestCase -Dserver.list=ESB

    To run a test package.
       ant run-package -Djar.name=org.wso2.carbon.esb.tests-4.x.x-tests.jar -Dpackage.name=org.wso2.carbon.esb.proxyservice.test.* -Dserver.list=ESB
